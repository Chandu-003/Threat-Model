# Threat Model

## Overview
Threat Model is a Python-based framework designed to streamline the process of threat modeling. Integrating threat modeling directly into the development workflow empowers security teams and developers to collaboratively identify, assess, and mitigate risks efficiently.

## Features
- **Code-Driven Threat Modeling:** Define threat models programmatically.
- **Automated Analysis:** Perform risk assessments automatically.
- **Visual Representation:** Generate threat model diagrams for better understanding.
- **Extensible Design:** Add custom threat definitions and analysis workflows.
- **Integration Ready:** Seamlessly integrate into CI/CD pipelines.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chandu-003/Threat-Model.git
   cd Threat Model
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Quick Start
1. Import the library in your project:
   ```python
   from tmascode import cluster, helpers, threats
   ```
2. Define a threat model example:
   ```python
   from tmascode.threats import Threat

   threat = Threat(name='SQL Injection', description='Potential SQL vulnerability detected.')
   threat.assess()
   ```
3. Run the analysis script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
4. Visualize the generated diagrams in the output folder.
